# Early Adoption eligibility checker

## for CSM Holesky testnet

This is a simple interface where you can check if your address is on the CSM Early Adoption (EA) list for Holesky testnet. The Early Adoption list for CSM testnet uses four main sources of addresses:

- [Solo-stakers list curated by Rated](https://github.com/rated-network/solo-stakers)
- [CSM-related Galxe OATs holders with 5+ points](https://app.galxe.com/quest/lido/GCPoDUBedQ)
- [Obol Techne credential holders](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917/46)
- [Solo-stakers list curated by StakeCat](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers)

If you assume your address is in one of these sources, please connect the corresponding wallet to this page to check if youâ€™re eligible to join CSM in the Early Adoption phase, or check it manually in the [.json](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/blob/main/artifacts/holesky/early-adoption/addresses.json) file
