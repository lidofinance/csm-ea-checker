# Early Adoption eligibility checker

This is a simple interface where you can check if your address is on the CSM Early Adoption (EA) list for Mainnet. The Early Adoption list for CSM Mainnet uses six main sources of addresses:

- [Solo-stakers list curated by Rated](https://github.com/rated-network/solo-stakers)
- [CSM-related Galxe OATs holders with 6+ points](https://app.galxe.com/quest/lido/leaderboard)
- [Obol Techne credential holders](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917/46)
- [Solo-stakers list curated by StakeCat](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers)
- [Good performers from the CSM Testnet](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-oracle/tree/feat/perf-data-collector)
- [Purchasers of Dappnode Home x Lido before September 30th](https://dappnode.com/collections/hot-releases/products/home-lido)

If you assume your address is in one of these sources, please connect the corresponding wallet to this page to check if youâ€™re eligible to join the CSM in the Early Adoption phase, or check it manually in the [.json](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/blob/main/artifacts/mainnet/early-adoption/addresses.json) file
